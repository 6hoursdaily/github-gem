The GitHub Gem
=============

This gem'll work hand-in-hand with GitHub's API to help you out.

The vision is for this gem to help you:
  - Manage forks / remotes
  - Query the site (`svn info`)
  - git push + pull request

The project will have an open commit bit: send us a cool patch, get write access.  Let's do this.
